## TODO
- Verify that simplified crank callback has eliminated missed events
- Fix: If displaying gears, display will update on half-second intervals only if the integer resistance changes
- In power save, verify waitForEvent() behavior (need or not for current two calls)
- In update_resistance(), correct the logic regarding when the gear needs to be determined
- Consider using a different reference, e.g., Vdd ref for the pot to maintain cal near battery end of charge
- Consider closer look at what needs to be recalculated under different circumstances - e.g., no need to re-do resistance calc if the value hasn't changed at all
- Calibration items
  - Save calibration in littleFS
  - Automated sensor calibration, equivalent to Keiser's procedure
- Console access
  - Bluetooth console
  - Does USB or BLEUart console preclude need for bike-based cal triggers like Keiser's?
- Keeping more parameters or options in the filesystem
- If continuing to implement FTMS, implement a real model-based calc for speed (mph/kph) as a function of power and cadence
- Clean up code in connect callbacks
- Look at ways to further save power, especially when not connected
  - Check whether waitForEvent() is as effective as other means
  - If the hardware reset button is exposed, little harm in just shutting down
- Use a proper (pixel-based) right-justification on the display
- Something more flexible and elegant than the current hard-coded display routine
  - In any event, choose between globals and arguments on the display routine(s)
- Improve the display: larger size or double area
  - Things maybe to add
    - Accumulated  data
      - Miles - requires a model
      - Calories - requires a model
      - Elapsed time
- Other uses for swings of the resistance lever as a signal
  - e.g., reset ride between people

ONE DAY?
- Servo on the resistance for full FTMS function!
