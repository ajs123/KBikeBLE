## TODO
- Documentation
  - More comprehensive writeup of calibration
  - Tutorial how-to-build for less experienced folks
  - Writeup on power consumption
  - Better writeup on calibration
- Calibration
  - Consider Vdd ref for the pot to maintain cal near battery end of charge
- Keeping more parameters or options in the filesystem, such as
  - Gear vs. Res% display
  - Filtering
- Consider flashing the gear/resistance display when the lever is at the top (instead of Keiser's "88").
- BLE Services
  - If continuing to support FTMS, implement a real model-based calc for speed (mph/kph) as a function of power and cadence. 
- Improve the display: larger size with more data?
  - Things maybe to add
    - Accumulated  data
      - Miles - requires a model
      - Calories - requires a model
      - Elapsed time
- Other uses for swings of the resistance lever as a signal
  - e.g., reset ride between people, if providing accumulated data
- More comprehensive code cleanup
  - Split code across multiple source files
  - Clean up code in connect callbacks
  - Code to include a battery or not is a bit clunky, especially in display_numbers()
  - Review for functions that should be inline
  - C++ style static consts and inline functions instead of C-style #defines and macros where appropriate
- Option to power down the crank sensor (total power-down), for those who plan to expose a reset or wakeup switch on the packaged computer. This might not provide any meaningful advantage unless there's also a way to power down the display.

ONE DAY?
- Servo on the resistance for full FTMS function!
