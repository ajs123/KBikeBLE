## Changelog
- V0.7
  - Initial release
- V0.8
  - Protect cadence calculation from the crank event interrupt
  - Changed the advertised name
  - Very rudimentary battery level (percentage text)
  - Changed ADC to 10 bits for improved delineation between gears
  - Measure resistance 2/sec. Simple tick-based "scheduler" to do resistance check, battery check, other stuff as needed
  - Some other cleanup of the main loop
- V0.9
  - Settable transmit power and BLE LED interval. Default to -12 dB and 3000 ms.
  - BLE shutdown after settable time without pedaling. This will force a disconnect from any app, though apps left running are free to reconnect when the bike wakes up.
  - #define SERIAL enables debug messages to the serial monitor (no more commenting out)
  - #define DEBUG provides conditional messages to the serial monitor
- V0.10
  - Rudimentary serial console to support calibration
- V0.11
  - New default cal values - new test bike, and new norms for R to match the published Keiser graph
  - Stopped filtering cadence and power since apps do that (check on whether the display is OK)
- V0.12
  - Some cleanup
  - Small tweaks to the display; improvements to dim/powersave code
  - Began inserting code to use BLEUart as an alternative to serial over USB
  - Optional (for now) power saving measures:
    - De-energize the resistance sensing pot
    - Processor power save idle in the main loop, using Open RTOS waitForEvent()
  - ADC oversampling to reduce resistance measurement noise
  - Eliminated change in ADC settings when checking the battery (higher resolution not needed)
- V0.13
  - Table lookup instead of quadratic fit for gear determination
    - Using more evenly spaced gears than Keiser's originals. power_gear_tables.h has the Keiser originals.
  - Table interpolation instead of polynomial fits for power determination
  - Simplified crank callback
  - Wakeup after display has been off forces immediate battery check
  - #define option to power down completely, with pedaling causing a full reset
- V0.14
  - Use the FreeRTOS tick count for crank timing, since that's how millis() is determined. This sticks us with the default 1/1024 sec tick rate. An alternative is to use micros() *if* that function is using a hardware counter. The available DWT counter stops when the CPU is idled, presumably including calls to delay(). See https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/issues/451. 
  - Added BLE battery service
  - Cleaned up display code: Whether to redraw is determined in the display function based on actual displayed values. Changes in GEAR / RES % labels handled more gracefully.
- V0.15
  - Fixed truncation error in the battery display
  - Cleaner display update code
  - Options for filtering resistance readings to reduce noise
  - The power-saving timeout is now dependent upon whether there's a Bluetooth connection. This allows specification of a longer time that the user can walk away from the bike without ending a session.
  - Fixed missing #ifdef by which serial port code was being compiled despite USE_SERIAL being undefined
  - Replaced the main loop() with a scheduled task. If not choosing full shutdown for power save mode, the timer is stopped for power save and restarted when pedaling resumes. Power savings is essentially the same either way.
