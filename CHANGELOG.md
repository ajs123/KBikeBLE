## Changelog
- V0.7
  - Initial release
- V0.8
  - Protect cadence calculation from the crank event interrupt
  - Changed the advertised name
  - Very rudimentary battery level (percentage text)
  - Changed ADC to 10 bits for improved delineation between gears
  - Measure resistance 2/sec. Simple tick-based "scheduler" to do resistance check, battery check, other stuff as needed
  - Some other cleanup of the main loop
- V0.9
  - Settable transmit power and BLE LED interval. Default to -12 dB and 3000 ms.
  - BLE shutdown after settable time without pedaling. This will force a disconnect from any app, though apps left running are free to reconnect when the bike wakes up.
  - #define SERIAL enables debug messages to the serial monitor (no more commenting out)
  - #define DEBUG provides conditional messages to the serial monitor
- V0.10
  - Rudimentary serial console to support calibration
- V0.11
  - New default cal values - new test bike, and new norms for R to match the published Keiser graph
  - Stopped filtering cadence and power since apps do that (check on whether the display is OK)
- V0.12 IN PROGRESS
  - Some cleanup
  - Small tweaks to the display; improvements to dim/powersave code
  - Began inserting code to use BLEUart as an alternative to serial over USB
  - Optional (for now) power saving measures:
    - De-energize the resistance sensing pot
    - Processor power save idle in the main loop, using Open RTOS waitForEvent()
  - ADC oversampling to reduce resistance measurement noise
